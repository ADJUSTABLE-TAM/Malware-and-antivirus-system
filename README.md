# Malware-and-antivirus-system
Main.exe is the antivirus system.
The database is the MD5.txt, make sure the main.exe is always with the MD5.txt or the antivirus system won't work.

if the main.exe doesn't work. Use main.py. The library is added, however, it won't work with the main.py, you would still need to import the libraries.

Make sure not to run any malware an actual device, as it could harm the device.
